## Introduction

The real estate market is inherently dynamic and prone to fluctuations which impacts a wide array of stakeholders. These include investors, employees, tenants, property management teams, supply chain vendors, and the surrounding communities. The primary objective of this project was to develop a predictive model capable of accurately estimating real estate prices based on a set of predefined input features.

## Models

**Model: Linear Regression**

Linear regression was chosen as the baseline model for this project due to its simplicity and effectiveness, as evidenced by the literature. It is widely recognized in the real estate domain for its low prediction error when capturing relationships between features and target variable i.e. price. However, despite its merits, this model was not a perfect fit for the dataset at hand due to the potential issue of high cardinality among categorical variables, which if one hot encoded would lead to p \> n (variables \> observations)

**Model Variants Tested** In total seven variations of the linear regression model were estimated to evaluate performance, namely:

-   Linear-linear
-   Log-linear
-   Log-log
-   Multiple linear regression with only 5 regressors (house size, land size, baths, beds and sale frequency)
-   Interaction between house size and land size
-   Polynomial term for land size
-   Combined approach - Interaction term as well as polynomial term

Out of the above listed models the first three(Linear-linear, Log-linear, and Log-log) were estimated under two different transformations of the data-random sampling & stratified sampling. Among these, the log-log model demonstrated the best performance under both data. However, an analysis of the residual plots under random sampling revealed that the residuals were not randomly distributed. This issue was addressed when stratified sampling technique was applied, the residuals now seemed to have a roughly constant variance. Therefore, the model with stratified was chosen as the best one, even through the R-squared value was slightly higher with the random sampling (60% with random sampling vs 58% with stratified). An analysis of the Q-Q plots showed the residuls cclosely followed the dashed line except the tails on either side which exhibited notable deviations, suggesting the presence of extreme outliers, therefore model is expected to be impacted in case of predictions related to extreme values(Luxury houses).

**Log-Log Model Performance Metrics**

The performance of the log-log linear regression model was evaluated using standard metrics as represented below -

| Metric                         | Value           |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|
| Mean Absolute Error (MAE)      | 187,846.8       |
| Mean Squared Error (MSE)       | 188,307,816,638 |
| Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) | 433,944.5       |
| R-Squared                      | 53.71%          |

**Results**

RMSE: On average, the model exhibits a deviation of \$433,944.5 per prediction. The RMSE value of 433,944.5 is considered acceptable given that the price range of the properties in the dataset is in the millions.

MSE: The high value of the MSE suggests that outliers are significantly influencing the results,which consistent the observations from the Q-Q plots.

R-Squared: The value of 53.71% falls within the acceptable range for real estate price prediction, particularly for high-variance datasets like this one.

**Comparison to Benchmark Values**

Studies in the real estate domain indicate that values of R-squared typically range between 0.40 and 0.80. Simpler models applied to high-variance datasets often yield values in the lower range. For real estate models in expensive markets such as New York City or San Francisco, RMSE greater than \$100,000 are common due to high property values. In light of these benchmarks, the performance of the baseline linear regression model aligns with expectations for real estate price prediction using datasets with significant variance.
