## Introduction

The real estate market is inherently dynamic and prone to fluctuations which impacts a wide array of stakeholders. These include investors, employees, tenants, property management teams, supply chain vendors, and the surrounding communities. The primary objective of this project was to develop a predictive model capable of accurately estimating real estate prices based on a set of predefined input features.
