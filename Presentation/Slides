## Relevance of Data-driven approach in Real Estate

```{r eruptions}
inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_breaks", label = "Number of bins:",
              choices = c(10, 20, 35, 50), selected = 20),
  
  sliderInput("bw_adjust", label = "Bandwidth adjustment:",
              min = 0.2, max = 2, value = 1, step = 0.2)
)

renderPlot({
  hist(faithful$eruptions, probability = TRUE, breaks = as.numeric(input$n_breaks),
       xlab = "Duration (minutes)", main = "Geyser eruption duration")
  
  dens <- density(faithful$eruptions, adjust = input$bw_adjust)
  lines(dens, col = "blue")
})

-   Finding & Evaluation




## Relevance of Data-driven approach in Real Estate


## About the Data: Source & Characteristics

-   The dataset 
-   Bullet 2
-   Bullet 3

## Data Cleaning: Before Sampling 

 - Dropped the states that weren't in mainland USA.
 - Created a unique id using composite key to remove duplicates. 
 - Only included the most recent sale of observations.
 - Included a column called sale frequency that represents the number of times the house has been sold in the past.

## Sampling Technique
- Stratified sampling based on house size, number of bedrooms and baths

```{r Histogram displaying house size distribution}

ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = house_size)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = "blue", color = "white", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "House Size Distribution",
    x = "House Size (sq ft)",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```
