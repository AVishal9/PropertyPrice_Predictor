## Agenda

-   Introduction
-   Data & Data Cleaning
-   Findings from Exploratory Analysis
-   Models
-   Finding & Evaluation
-   Limitations 


## Relevance of Data-driven approach in Real Estate


## About the Data: Source & Characteristics

-   The original dataset was a csv file containing real estate listings in the USA categorised by states, city and zipcode.
-   Includes 12 different features and more than 2 million entries 
-   he data had 6 categorical variables some of which had highly cardinality.

## Data Cleaning: Before Sampling 

 - Dropped the states that weren't in mainland USA.
 - Created a unique id using composite key to remove duplicates. 
 - Only included the most recent sale of observations.
 - Included a column called sale frequency that represents the number of times the house has been sold in the past.

## Sampling Technique
- Stratified sampling based on house size, number of bedrooms and baths

```{r Histogram displaying house size distribution}

ggplot(clean_data, aes(x = house_size)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 100, fill = "blue", color = "white", alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "House Size Distribution",
    x = "House Size (sq ft)",
    y = "Count"
  ) +
  theme_bw()
```
## Data Preprocessing: After Sampling 

## Data Exploration 
 - Analysed ratios to gain insights from the data
         - Price per square foot 
         - Bathrooms/Bedrooms

```{r Plot showing Bathroom to Bedroom Ratio}
ratiob <- stratified_sample%>%
  mutate(ratio_bb = bath/bed)

#Summary statistics of this new variable
summary(ratiob$ratio_bb) #There are maximum three bathrooms per bedroom which is acceptable

# Visual Inspection
ratiob %>% 
  dplyr::select(ratio_bb) %>% 
  gather() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value)) +
  facet_wrap(~ key, scales = "free") +
  geom_bar()  
```

## Models 

- Linear Regression - 
- Random Forest 
- XGBoost 


## Evaluation 
                              **Model Performance Metric**

| Model             | Mean Absolute Error (MAE) | Mean Squared Error (MSE) | Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) | R-Squared |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|------------|------------|
| Linear Regression | 187,846.8                 | 188,307,816,638          | 433,944.5                      | 53.71%    |
| XGBoost           | 164636.4                  | 173634154264             | 416,694.3                      | 62.56%    |
|                   |                           |                          |                                |           |
|                   |                           |                          |                                |           |


â€¢	Limitations/Problems 

-	No unique ID in the dataset.
-	High cardinality of categorical variables increased the dimensionality of the data 
-	High variance in the dataset as it is not particularly for residential real estate, therefore huge outliers in terms of land size.
- Can be complemented with data on market dynamics
